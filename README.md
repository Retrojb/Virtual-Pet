#Virtual Pet

the overall objective is to make and use classes 
while implementing a game loop with a tick method

the game loop runs on a do / while loop as long as attributes are above a certain level

Attirbutes when I feed it hunger decreases and rest increase
thirst decreases and play increases
rest decrease and hunger increases
play decrease and hunger and thirst increase


I removed the attributes for the time being as I could not get them
to change the way I wanted.

I could not fully implement a tick system for the loop. 

I don't know exactly what it is that im not understanding.
